Animating GTFS data in Portland, Oregon

This repository contains the code and data used to create the below animation:

(It runs more smoothly in video format).

1) The `Data Wrangling` python notebook is used to download and manipulate the GTFS data into a form necessary for animation

2) The `gtfs` folder contains the raw gtfs that was downloaded using the python notebook

3) The `data.zip` file contains the clean csv that was generated by the python notebook

4) The `sketch` folder contains the Processing code used to create the animation

To run this locally:

* Download the repo
* Unzip the data.zip file
* Open the processing sketch and click play. 

You will need to have [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [Unfolding Maps](http://unfoldingmaps.org/) installed to play sketch. 

For the steps taken to download and manipulate the data, see `Data_Wrangling.ipynb`.
