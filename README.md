(It runs more smoothly in video format).

1) The `Data Wrangling` python notebook is used to download and manipulate the GTFS data into a form necessary for animation.

2) The `gtfs` folder contains the raw gtfs that was downloaded using the python notebook

3) The `data` folder will contain the clean csv that gets generated using the python notebook, once the notebook is run

4) The `sketch` folder contains the Processing code used to create the animation
